# Snakes And Ladders

## Project Motivation

The code provided here performs the Snakes And Ladders game, as depicted in the image below. 

The basic idea of the game is as follows: Each player begins on square 1 and takes turns rolling a fair 6-sided 
die. The player moves the number of spaces indicated on the die. If you land at the bottom of a ladder, you automatically move to the square 
at the top of the ladder. Conversely, if you land on a snake head, then you fall to the square at the snake's tail. The winner is the first person to 
make it onto or past the last square.


## Code Usage
The code contains some basic features for the snakes and ladders game. There are three main classes:
- SnakeLadders: The game itself, with two players and following the above logic
- SimulateGame: Passing a game, it perform the number of simulations required
- Overrall Statistics: Calculate the statistics to games simulated

## Instalation
- Numpy (1.16.2)
- Datetime (4.3)
- Random
